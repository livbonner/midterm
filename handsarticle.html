        <div class="handspara"><p>As crush month draws to a close, it felt vitally important to re-share Harling’s investigative masterpiece. Originally published in February 2018, this post is just as funny and heartwarming as it was last year. Enjoy and feel free to hold my hand at any time. - Nora.</p>
        <div class="p">One of my best friends and her new boyfriend held hands for the entirety of my four-hour holiday party in December, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. I was, to put it succinctly, perplexed — however, my reaction was a classic case of projection in that my feelings had absolutely nothing to do with them and absolutely everything to do with me.</div>
        <div class="p">Every time someone reaches to clasp my hand in theirs, be it a friend or boyfriend, I am immediately overcome with a feelings cocktail of 45% delight and 55% stress. I am delighted they want to hold my hand, and I am delighted by the feeling of this person’s hand in mine and mine in theirs, but I am stressed about the etiquette. What if my hand gets clammy? How do I shift the position of my hand without disturbing the equilibrium of this precarious entrapment? Given the fact that at some point we will have to part claws, which one of us should initiate the separation? If grades are being handed out for the act of hand-holding, how can I guarantee myself an A+?</div>

        <div class="p">Ultimately, I’m not sure whether hand-holding is a dreamy nightmare or a nightmarish dream. All I know is I love it and hate it simultaneously and would rather not deal with it at all but would also be devastated if my hands were suddenly relegated to the lesser company of spoons and toothbrushes forevermore.</div>
       <div class="p">Curious if I was alone in this tornado of inner turmoil, I posed the following question to the internet: “Does anyone actually like holding hands?” The responses came by the bucketful, all of which I consumed with a voraciousness previously reserved for newly released Harry Potter installments and pasted them into a document that soon reached 18 pages (a hand-holding treatise, if you will).</div>
        <div class="p">I read it again — once, twice, three times. Digested as a whole, the hundreds of responses lodged a fully unexpected lump in my throat. For as much as the prospect of interlaced fingers has caused me stress, I never stopped to consider its simple, extraordinary power as humanity’s connective tissue — not the kind we’re born with that binds all our organs together, but the kind we create ourselves that binds us, as people, together.</div>
        <div class="p">I divided the responses up by category for your viewing pleasure. Have a scroll and let me know what you think in the comments. I’ll be waiting with both hands outstretched, plus a bottle of Purell.</div></div>
